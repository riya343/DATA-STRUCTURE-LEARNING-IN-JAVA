----------------------------------INTRODUCTION TO ARRAY---------------------------------
Array is a collection of similar type of data stored in a continuous memory.
 Example : int a,b,c,d,e;
      In code we write : int arr[] = new int[5];

>> DECLARATION
   int[] arr = new int[5];

>> INTTIALIZATION
   int[] arr = [ 10,20,30,40};

>> HOW TO TAKE INPUT
   for (int i=0; i<n, i++){
     arr[i] = sc.nextInt();}

>> for( int i=0;arr.length;i++ ){
    System.out.println( arr[i] + " ");  // for space ( + " ");
-------------------------------------------------------------- Basic code to write for understanding -------------------------------------------------------
- Linear Search in Array 
  first take input for elements
  input for target
  then write condition in main [ n == tar]
  then in main write condtion if true return n
  else return -1 
  and remeber to write -1 after loop.
- Finding index of target element 
  just made two thing target and index 
intialize target with the target no. and index with 0
then use loop and get ans  
- Understanding return -1 logic  
- Importance of loop structure  

🟢 DAY 3 
Arrays in Java are Reference Types
Array variable stores address, not actual data.
Arrays are Passed by Reference
When array is sent to a function, original array is passed.
Changes in Function Affect Original Array
Modification inside method = modification in main array.
Assignment Does NOT Create Copy
Java
Copy code
int[] b = a;
a and b point to same array.
Need for Real Copy
Direct assignment is NOT independent copy.
Correct Ways to Copy Array
Manual loop copy
clone() method
Java
Copy code
int[] b = a.clone();
Returning Array from Function is Allowed
Functions can return whole array.
Side Effect Concept
Passing array can unintentionally modify original data.
Primitive vs Array Difference
Primitive → pass by value
Array → pass by reference
Key Takeaway
Always be careful when modifying arrays inside functions.
